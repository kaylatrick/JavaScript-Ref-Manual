#Javascript Manual

##values, data types
Data types:
- Primitive: String, number, boolean, null, undefined
- Object

Value:
- raw data assigned to a variable
- String: immutable list of characters, ex: 'value' or "value" (can be single or double quotes)
- Number: numeric, example: 4
- Boolean: true/false
- Null: has a value of null
- undefined: not assigned a value
- Object: series of key-value pairs (ex {foo: 4})

##operations / operators / operands
Operators: plus, minus, multiply, divide (in 5+3, '+' is the operator)
Operand: values being acted upon by an operator (in 5+3, 5 and 3 are the operands)
Operation: process of using operators and operands (in 5+3, '5+3' is the operation)

##variables, var
variable: reference to a piece of data in memory (ex: var x = 4;)

##reserved words
select words in the language that have a specific meaning (ex: for, where, function)

##statements vs. expressions
Statement: describes a complete action, whether it returns a value or not (ex: if(true) {console.log("hi")};)
Expression: anything that resolves in a value (ex: var y = 1 + 2;)

##variables vs. values
variable references a String or another data type, while a value is that piece of data in memory
ex: var x = 4; (x is the variable, while 4 is the expression)
